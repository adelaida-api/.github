# ✈️ AirportAPI

**AirportAPI** is an open API platform designed to simplify, secure, and visualise API access for developers and third-party systems. Unlike Swagger or OpenAPI, which focus solely on documentation, AirportAPI offers a full-stack solution for API publishing, invocation, protection, billing, and analytics.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 **Secure API Gateway**: Built-in access control, rate limiting, and user authentication.
- 📊 **Usage Statistics**: Real-time monitoring of API calls, visualised via dashboards.
- 📄 **API Documentation**: Automatically generated OpenAPI/Swagger spec.
- 🧑‍💻 **Developer Portal**: Frontend developers can browse, test, and call APIs easily.
- ⚙️ **Admin Panel**: Full CRUD management of API definitions and user access.
- 💸 **Billing Support**: Track and enforce usage-based billing policies (planned).
- 📦 **SDK Generator**: Generate and download client SDKs for fast integration (planned).

## 💡 Use Cases

- Frontend teams accessing backend APIs without backend involvement
- Exposing internal APIs to trusted third-party services (e.g., operations job schedulers, monitoring systems)
- Managing third-party API integration securely and with call limits
- Visualising API usage and enforcing cost control via billing mechanisms

## 🧱 Tech Stack
